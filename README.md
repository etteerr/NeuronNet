# NeuronNet
A neural network simulator based on python

This neural network simulator is a project for my internship at the University of Amsterdam.
If you have tips or fixes, you can email me via this github account.

The simulator is based on the Hodgkin and Huxleyâ€™s model: Conductance based spike initiation and propagation, a single neuron model. The connections, or synapses, use a Hodgkin and Huxley derived model similar to synaptic transmission. Finally, these two models are programmatically connected to represent a functional biological network. Offline calculations are used to create calcium traces and finally create a calcium imaging video.
